## 🎯 FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Vercel Dashboard
I opened it for you, or go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**

### Step 2: DELETE the Old Project (Important!)
1. Find your **MIKORK** project
2. Click on it
3. Go to **Settings** (bottom left)
4. Scroll to bottom: **"Delete Project"**
5. Type the project name to confirm
6. Click **"Delete"**

### Step 3: Create NEW Project from GitHub
1. Click **"Add New..."** → **"Project"**
2. Click **"Import Git Repository"**
3. If not connected, click **"Connect GitHub Account"**
4. Find: **parlaycomcapital/MIKORK**
5. Click **"Import"**

### Step 4: Configure Deployment
**LEAVE EVERYTHING DEFAULT!**
- Framework Preset: **Other** (or leave as-is)
- Root Directory: `./`
- Build Command: (leave empty)
- Output Directory: `./`  
- Install Command: (leave empty)

**Just click "Deploy"!**

### Step 5: Wait & Test
1. Wait 30-60 seconds for deployment
2. Vercel will give you a URL like: `mikork-xxx.vercel.app`
3. Click the URL
4. ✅ **Website should work now!**

---

## 🔗 Connect GitHub for Auto-Deploy

After it works, in your project:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Git**
2. Should already be connected to: `parlaycomcapital/MIKORK`
3. ✅ Now every `git push` auto-deploys!

---

## ✅ What Changed (Already on GitHub)

✅ Fixed Vercel configuration  
✅ New logo installed  
✅ Enhanced design  
✅ Better header visibility  
✅ All ready to deploy!  

---

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

**404 Error After Deploy?**
- Make sure you're going to the right URL (check Vercel dashboard)
- Try: `your-url.vercel.app` (production URL)
- NOT: `your-url-git-main.vercel.app` (preview URL)

**Can't find GitHub repo?**
- Click "Add GitHub Account" in Vercel
- Authorize Vercel to access your repos
- Then import parlaycomcapital/MIKORK

**Deploy fails?**
- Check deployment logs in Vercel
- Make sure all files are on GitHub (they are!)
- Try again - sometimes Vercel has hiccups

## 💡 Why This Will Work Now

**I fixed:**
1. ✅ Simplified `vercel.json` (was too complex)
2. ✅ Pushed all changes to GitHub
3. ✅ Fresh deployment will use correct config

**You need to:**
1. Delete old broken project
2. Import fresh from GitHub
3. Let Vercel auto-detect as static site
4. ✅ Done!
